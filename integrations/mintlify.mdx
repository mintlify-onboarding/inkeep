## What is Mintlify

[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) offers beautiful documentation that helps converts users. It powers our own docs including this page.

We've partnered with Mintlify to bring Inkeep's search and chat services to Mintlify customers. The integration is as easy as turning on a toggle on your Mintlify dashboard, no Inkeep account or setup required. Learn more [here](https://mintlify.com/docs/integrations/inkeep).

Once on, the chat experience on Mintlify's search bar will be powered by Inkeep's chat engine. We've worked closely with Mintlify to develop the best strategies for answering customer questions based on your Mintlify documentation. Content is automatically kept up to date every time you make a deployment.

For Mintlify customers, we also offer two deals that make it easy to go beyond LLM powered-search for your documentation.
